# whether to open a graphical window with Serena's logs.
# This is mainly supported on Windows and (partly) on Linux; not available on macOS.
# If you want to see the logs in a web browser, use the `web_dashboard` option instead.
# Limitations: doesn't seem to work with the community version of Claude Desktop for Linux
# Might also cause problems with some MCP clients - if you have any issues, try disabling this

# Being able to inspect logs is useful both for troubleshooting and for monitoring the tool calls,
# especially when using the agno playground, since the tool calls are not always shown,
# and the input params are never shown in the agno UI.
# When used as MCP server for Claude Desktop, the logs are primarily for troubleshooting.
# Note: unfortunately, the various entities starting the Serena server or agent do so in
# mysterious ways, often starting multiple instances of the process without shutting down
# previous instances. This can lead to multiple log windows being opened, and only the last
# window being updated. Since we can't control how agno or Claude Desktop start Serena,
# we have to live with this limitation for now.
