# To build a planning document

We are going to build a file called PLANNING.md which lives in the project's root directory.  The objective is to have a document that will give you important context about the project, along with instructions on how to build and test.  Start by building a document with the following categories, that we will initially mark as TBD.  Then we will discuss each of these points together and fill in the document as we go.

- Project Overview
- Architecture
  - Core components (API, Data, Service layers, configuration, etc)
  - Data Model, if the project has a database component
- API endpoints, if the project exposes endpoints to be consumed
- Technology stack (Language, frameworks, etc)
- Project structure
- Testing strategy, if the project uses unit or integration testing
- Development commands (to build,Data Model, if the project has a database component
- API endpoints, if the project exposes endpoints to be consumed
- Technology stack (Language, frameworks, etc)
- Project structure
- Testing strategy, if the project uses unit or integration tests.
- Development commands (for building, running, etc).
- Environment setup (how the development environment is currently set up for the project)
- Development guidelines (rules to follow when modifying the project)
- Security considerations (things to keep in mind that are security-focused when modifying the project)
- Future considerations (things that we may not be adding right away but would be candidates for future versions)

We will BUILD a file called TASK.md which lives in the project's root directory.  The objective is to give you important context about what tasks have been accomplished, and what work is left to do.  READ the PLANNING.md file, then create a list of tasks that you think should be accomplished.  Categorize them appropriately (e.g. Setup, Core Functionality, etc).  The last category will be "Completed Work" where we will have a log of work that has been completed, although initially this will be empty.
