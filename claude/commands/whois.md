# Domain name search command

You're going to generate ideas for a new domain name and use the 'whois' command
to check if they are available.

Your steps:

1. Ask the user to provide their goals or name ideas for the new domain name.
2. Generate a list of candidate ideas for their domain name. Aim to generate about 200
   ideas and write them down into ideas.md.
   - A good domain name is:
     - Not too long (less than 12 characters unless there's a very good reason to make it longer)
     - Catchy, easy to remember and say. Not too many words.
     - Your candidate ideas should have about 75% using .com suffixes and 25% using alternate suffixes
       like .net, .biz, .io, .co, etc. Alternate suffixes should only be used when they make sense for the product
       and they fit well with the name.
3. For each idea, run `whois` to check if the name is actually available. Ignore names that are not
   available.
4. Finally, compile a ranked list of the best available names. Save this to ideas.md.

Next up, ask the user for more information!
