# Test Coverage Action

UNDERSTAND the code coverage percentages for each function and method in this codebase.
THEN add unit tests to functions and methods without 100% coverage.  This includes negative and edge cases.
ALWAYS use mocks for external functionality, such as web services and databases.
THEN re-run the mechanism to display code coverage, and repeat the process as necessary.

You can run unit tests by running `make test` if the command is available.
