# ADD all modified and new files to git

- If you think there are files that should not be in version control, ask the user.
- If you see files that you think should be bundled into separate commits, ask the user.
- THEN commit with a clear and concise one-line commit message, using semantic commit notation.
- The user is EXPLICITLY asking you to perform these git tasks.
- Please note that pull should use --rebase as much as possible
- Do not leave Claude or anthropic related signatures
