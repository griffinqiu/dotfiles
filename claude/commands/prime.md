# Project Understanding Prompt

When starting a new session, follow this systematic approach to understand the project:

## Project Overview & Structure

- **READ** the README.md file in the project's root folder, if available. This provides the user-facing perspective and basic setup instructions.
- **RUN** `git ls-files` to get a complete file inventory and understand the project structure.
- **EXAMINE** the project's directory structure to understand the architectural patterns (e.g., `/cmd`, `/internal`, `/pkg` for Go projects).

## Core Documentation

- **READ and UNDERSTAND** the PLANNING.md file for:
  - Project architecture and design decisions
  - Technology stack and dependencies
  - Build, test, and deployment instructions
  - Future considerations and roadmap
- **READ and UNDERSTAND** the TASK.md file for:
  - Completed work and implementation status
  - Current blockers or known issues
  - Next steps and priorities

## Testing & Quality

- **EXAMINE** test files to understand:
  - Testing patterns and frameworks used
  - Test coverage expectations
  - Integration vs unit test separation
  - Mock implementations and test utilities

## Development Workflow

- **CHECK** for automation files:
  - CI/CD pipelines (.github/workflows, .gitea/workflows)
  - Development environment setup (devenv.nix, .devcontainer)
  - Code quality tools (linting, formatting configurations)

## Data & External Systems

- **IDENTIFY** data models and schemas:
  - Database migrations or schema files
  - API specifications or OpenAPI docs
  - Data transfer objects (DTOs) and validation rules
- **UNDERSTAND** external service integrations:
  - Authentication providers (Keycloak, Auth0)
  - Databases and connection patterns
  - Third-party APIs and clients

## Documentation Maintenance

- **UPDATE TASK.md** with each substantial change made to the project, including:
  - Features implemented or modified
  - Issues resolved or discovered
  - Dependencies added or updated
  - Configuration changes
- **UPDATE PLANNING.md** if changes affect:
  - Architecture decisions
  - Technology stack
  - Development workflows
  - Future roadmap items

## Knowledge Validation

Before proceeding with any work, confirm understanding by being able to answer:

- What is the primary purpose of this project?
- How do I build, test, and run it locally?
- What are the main architectural components and their responsibilities?
- What external systems does it integrate with?
- What's the current implementation status and what's next?
